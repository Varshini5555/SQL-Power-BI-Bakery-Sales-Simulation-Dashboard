# SQL-Power-BI-Bakery-Sales-Simulation-Dashboard

**Real-Time Sales Simulation**

**Project Overview:**

This repository contains the code and resources for a real-time sales simulation of a bakery business. The project combines SQL Server for data management and Power BI for data visualization to create a dynamic and interactive sales monitoring system.

**Key Features:**

- **SQL Database**: The project starts by setting up a SQL Server database to store sales-related data. It includes tables for products, salespeople, order types, and customer orders.

- **Data Population**: Using SQL queries, the database is populated with sample data to simulate real-world transactions.

- **Sales Query**: A SQL query is developed to generate sales data automatically, providing a dynamic aspect to the simulation.

- **Power BI Integration**: The project showcases how to connect Power BI Desktop to the SQL Server database using the Direct Query connection method.

- **Relational Data Model**: Inside Power BI, a relational data model is created to establish connections between different tables, enabling comprehensive sales analysis.

- **Real-Time Dashboard**: A real-time sales dashboard is designed in Power BI, which displays key performance indicators (KPIs) and allows for interactive exploration of sales data.
